# Euler Solutions

These are my solutions to the Project Euler problems.

I've tried to adhere to the following for each solution:

- Easily understood
- Reusable, if not a single line solution
- Optimized for performance
- Using only the standard libraries for the chosen language

*TODO: Add a link to blog detailing decisions made for each solution.*
